# Module 1: Onboarding & Setup (A one-time process by the Caregiver)

This stage establishes the account and configures the system for the elderly user.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI components, React Router for navigation
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, JWT for authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB for user account storage
- **Validation**: Client-side form validation with server-side data sanitization

## Screen 1.1: Unified Account Registration
- **Purpose**: To create one single, uniquely identifiable account for the elderly person, with the caregiver assigned as the manager
- **User Inputs**:
  - **Section A: Details of the Person You Are Caring For**
    - Elderly Person's Full Name
    - Elderly Person's Age
    - Elderly Person's Phone Number (Mobile or household landline)
    - Elderly Person's Email Address
  - **Section B: Your Details (The Caregiver)**
    - Your Name
    - Your Phone Number (This will be your login username)
    - Your Email
    - Preferred Language (English, Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam)
- **Workflow**: The caregiver fills out this single form. The backend creates a primary user account with the elderly person's phone/email as its unique identifier and links the caregiver's details to it as the administrator.

## Screen 1.2: Caregiver Login
- **Purpose**: To allow the authenticated caregiver to access the main dashboard for configuration and monitoring
- **User Inputs**:
  - Caregiver's Name
  - Caregiver's Phone Number
- **Workflow**: The caregiver logs in using their credentials. The backend authenticates them and grants access to the Caretaker Dashboard.

## Screen 1.3: System Configuration (from the Dashboard)
- **Purpose**: To input all the necessary health and safety information into the system
- **User Inputs (for Medication)**:
  - Medicine Name
  - Dosage
  - Specific Times for each dose
  - Prescription Days
- **User Inputs (for Emergency Contacts)**:
  - Contact's Name
  - Contact's Phone Number
  - Contact's Email ID
  - Role (selected from dropdown: Private Ambulance, Caretaker, Relative)
- **Workflow**: From the dashboard, the caregiver selects "Add Medicine" and "Add Emergency Contacts" to input all the required details.

## Process 1.4: Preparing the Elderly User's Device
- **Purpose**: To authorize the elderly person's device for permanent, login-free access
- **User Inputs**:
  - Caregiver performs one-time login on elderly user's device
- **Workflow**: The caregiver performs a one-time login on the elderly person's device. The backend generates a device token linked to the elderly person's account, which is saved permanently on the device for automatic authentication.

# Module 2: The Elderly User's Experience (Daily Use)

This is the simplified, day-to-day interaction for the elderly person.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with simplified UI components, large touch targets for accessibility
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, JWT device token authentication
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.IO for instant notifications, Web Notifications API

- **Workflow**: The app automatically uses the saved device token to authenticate and loads the Dashboard Screen directly. The screen displays:
  - Current time and date
  - Upcoming medication reminders
  - Two large SOS buttons (Emergency & Family)
  - Medicine cards showing scheduled doses

## Process 2.2: Medication Reminder Cycle
- **Purpose**: To ensure medication is taken on time and to alert caregivers if it is not
- **Inputs**:
  - System Trigger: The scheduled medication time is reached
  - User Action: A single tap on the "Mark as Taken" button
- **Workflow**:
  1. A notification appears at the scheduled time with voice alert in preferred language
  2. User can mark medicine as taken immediately
  3. If not marked, system sends up to 3 voice reminders with 1-minute gaps
  4. If all reminders are missed, an automatic alert is sent to emergency contacts

---

# Module 3: The Elderly User's Emergency Experience

This flow is triggered when the user needs immediate assistance.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with countdown timer component, Material-UI dialogs
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, Socket.IO for real-time alerts
- **External Services**: Twilio API for SMS and voice calls, language translation services
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections for instant caregiver notifications

## Process 3.1: Triggering an SOS
- **Purpose**: To initiate an emergency alert
- **Inputs**:
  - User Action: A single tap on either "Emergency SOS" (for all contacts) or "Family SOS" (for caretaker/relatives only)
- **Workflow**: When the user taps an SOS button, the app immediately proceeds to the confirmation screen.

## Screen 3.2: SOS Confirmation Countdown
- **Purpose**: To prevent accidental alerts and allow the user to cancel
- **Inputs**:
  - User Action: A tap on the "Cancel SOS" button
  - System Trigger: A timeout event after the countdown (10 seconds) finishes
- **Workflow**:
  1. An overlay appears immediately, displaying a countdown from 10 seconds
  2. A prominent "Cancel SOS" button is available
  3. If the user taps "Cancel SOS": The alert process is stopped, returns to Home Screen
  4. If the user does nothing: The countdown reaches zero, and the app proceeds to send the alert

## Process 3.3: Alert Dissemination
- **Purpose**: To notify the Care Circle of the emergency
- **Inputs**:
  - System Trigger: The SOS confirmation countdown finishing without being canceled
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Emergency SOS**: Sends SMS and voice calls to ALL emergency contacts (caretaker, relatives, ambulance)
  2. **Family SOS**: Sends SMS to caretaker and relatives only (excludes ambulance)
  3. **Real-time Dashboard Alert**: Instantly notifies caregiver via web notification
  4. All messages are sent in the user's preferred language (English/Tamil/Hindi/Malayalam)
  5. The event is logged in the system for caregiver review
